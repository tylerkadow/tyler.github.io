					Is Bitcoin money (or can it become money) and how will it affect the economy?
				</p>
				<p class="justify">
					This was Tyler's Honor's paper on Bitcoin and its viability as money. He wrote this in order to graduate from Cleveland State University as a Scholars student, a program previously offered by the university similar to an Honors program.
				</p>
				<p class="justify">
					The paper discusses the three standard characteristics of money (medium of exchange, unit of account, and a store of value), and how these characteristics apply to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.
				</p>
				<p class="justify">
					The paper was written in 2013 and many developments have occurred since then in the cryptocurrency world. For example, the first sentence of the paper describes cryptocurrency as "a new phenomenon that is generally overlooked by the media," which is clearly no longer the case. However, the paper was well received by Tyler's economics professor and is still a good read to understand the basics of money and cryptocurrency.

					Psychic Game
				</p>
				<p class="justify">
					This is one of Tyler's first games that he designed. It utilizes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. On loading the game, it picks a random letter from a to z. The objective of the game is simply to guess that random stored letter in 10 guesses.
				</p>
				<p class="justify">
					When the player guesses an incorrect letter, that guess is stored in a variable called "displayGuesses" which is an array variable. That variable, and all the incorrect guesses stored in it, are then displayed on the screen. If the player selects a key that is not a letter, a window pops up stating, "please type a letter."
				</p>
				<p class="justify">
					If the player guesses correctly, a window pops up stating, "congratulations! You're psychic!" Then the "win" variable is increased by one and the total wins changes on the screen. If ten guesses go by and the player did not guess the correct letter in time, the "lose" variable increases by one and the total losses changes on the screen. Either way, a new game starts. Try it out <a target="_blank" class="bookish bold port-link" href="psychic.html">HERE</a>.

					My Little Pony Game
				</p>
				<p class="justify">
					This is one of Tyler's first games that he designed. It utilizes HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, and Bootstrap. Upon loading this game, the user is greeted with the My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic theme song. There is also a custom font used, just like that on the My Little Pony merchandise. (NOTE: My Little Pony is a brand that is wholly owned by Hasbro, Inc.)
				</p>
				<p class="justify">
					You are given four ponies to choose from. The objective is to save your three other pony friends from the clutches of Discord and his plans to spread disharmony across Equestria. This game's JavaScript contains multiple variables for each character. These variables are arrays that include their starting health, their attack power if they're your character, and their attack power if they are in the clutches of Discord's magic. When your character is selected, that character is highlighted in green and the "Friends in need" are highlighted in red and moved to the middle of the screen. Select one of your friends in need to help first and they will move from the middle to the right side of the screen.
				</p>
				<p class="justify">
					You can then select the "FRIENDSHIP!!!" button to try and bring harmony to your friends one at a time. If you help one of your friends and hit the "FRIENDSHIP!!!" button before selecting a new friend to help, a message appears, saying "there is nopony here to help." If you run out of Harmony Points before you save all your friends, you lose. Luckliy, a button appears saying, "Play Again" and you can try again to save Equestria from the dreaded Discord.

					API Giphy Search
				</p>
				<p class="justify">
					This was an individual assignment to build a website utilizing an API, or application protocol interface. It utilizes HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Bootstrap, and the giphy API.
				</p>
				<p class="justify">
					Giphy is a website where users can find, share, and generate gif images. The purpose of my website is to find gif images from giphy using key words. Before any API will work, an API key has to be generated. This key is used in the JavaScript/jQuery code to allow the JavaScript file to retrieve the images from the website.
					Users can also type in their own key words to search for related gif images. The images will not animate until the users clicks on the image.
				</p>
				<p class="justify">
					Try it for yourself <a target="_blank" class="bookish bold port-link" href="giphy.html">HERE</a> and find some cute cat images!

					Spontaneous
				</p>
				<p class="justify">
					This was a group project that Tyler was a part of during his time at Case Western Reserve University. It utilizes HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, and APIs. Spontaneous was a team effort by Dennis, Tyler, Christen & Phil. The team used GitHub to upload the files and work together.
				</p>
				<p class="justify">
					The project assignment was to develop an app that people could use in their daily lives, using APIs. We came up with Spontaneous. The website allows people to look up events happening near them by city and provides them links to purchase tickets online for the events. It also provides the weather for that city at the top of the screen, to alert the user if the weather in that city is good or not. Finally, there is a map on the bottom of the screen. This allows the user to search for directions to the venue.
				</p>
				<p class="justify">
					This app utilizes APIs from ticketmaster, mapbox, and openweathermap.org. Try it for yourself <a target="_blank" class="bookish bold port-link" href="spontaneous.html">HERE</a>. And if you have a good weekend, you know who to thank!

					Eat da Burger!
				</p>
				<p class="justify">
					Eat da burger was an exercise in utilizing MySQL databases and was uploaded onto Heroku during his time at Case Western Reserve University. It utilizes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, jQuery, and MySQL.
				</p>
				<p class="justify">
					Eat da burger is a simple project of sending commands to a database using MySQL commands. A burger can be added to the list of burgers to eat. Just type in the burger name into the dialouge box on the bottom and click the blue button. Then you can choose to either eat a burger and end up on the list of devoured burgers, or throw it away, which deletes the burger from the database entirely. The databse is hosted on heroku.

					NEWS API
				</p>
				<p class="justify">
					Tyler built this app on his own initiative to practice utilizing APIs, or application protocol interfaces. It utilizes HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Bootstrap, and the news API.
				</p>
				<p class="justify">
					The news API aggregates news stories from various sources. The JavaScript file pulls the first ten news stories from whichever news source the user selects. Then, it appends the HTML file with code that lists the stories and formats them.
				</p>
				<p class="justify">
					Catch the latest news <a class="bookish bold port-link" href="news.html">HERE</a>.

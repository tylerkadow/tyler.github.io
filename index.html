				Welcome to my website. Here, you will find all my coding projects for the world to see; past, present, and future.

				You can also see my appreciation of renowned 20th century Dutch painter Piet Mondrian on full display!

				A little bit about myself: I was born and raised in Lakewood, Ohio. After graduating from Cleveland State University cum laude with a Bachelor of Arts in Economics, I was unsure what career path resonated with me. I began at the Horseshoe Casino in Cleveland as a cashier and worked my way into the Finance department. After being promoted to Senior Accountant, I began to suspect that finance and accounting were not my callings in life. 
			</div>
			<div>
				I discovered coding and became very interested. After a semester of online Tri-C courses in computer science, my lovely wife discovered a coding boot camp at Case Western Reserve University. After just two days in the program, I instantly fell in love with coding!

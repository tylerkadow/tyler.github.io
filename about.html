				Tyler Kadow was born and raised in Lakewood, Ohio. He graduated from Cleveland State University cum laude with a Bachelor of Arts in Economics in 2013. Included in the portfolio section is his honors paper, which was about cryptocurrency and its viability as money. Tyler then began working at the Horseshoe Casino in Cleveland as a cashier and worked his way into the Accounting department. After the transition to JACK Cleveland Casino, he was promoted to Senior Accountant in January 2017.

				Tyler attended a coding bootcamp in late 2017 at Case Western Reserve University. There, Tyler developed his coding skills. He used those skills to code the items available on the profile page as well as this website.

				The COVID-19 pandemic has hit the gaming industry hard and JACK Cleveland Casino was forced to shut down by the state government. Unfortunately, after six great years in the gaming industry, Tyler was laid off due to the shut down.

				Tyler is currently looking for employment in the accounting/finance fields. He is also taking this time to improve on his skills. He is using Udemy, an American online learning platform aimed at professional adults and students, to learn more about forecasting with Excel. Tyler has also been training himself how to use Tableau, a popular software used to perform data analysis and visualize those results for presentations.
